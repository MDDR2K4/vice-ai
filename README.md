### 1. Core Problem

The modern mind is cluttered, leading to stress and indecision. There is no effective tool for privately dissecting and structuring one's own thoughts.

### 2. Our Solution

Vice AI is a tool to get a firm grip on your thoughts. Users speak their mind via voice notes. The AI listens, analyzes, and asks sharp, insightful questions to help the user achieve clarity. It is a tool for analysis, not just empathy.

### 3. Proposed Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React.js (with Vite)
*   **Backend:** Python with FastAPI
*   **Database:** Supabase
*   **AI APIs:** OpenAI Whisper API and GPT-4
*   **Deployment:** Vercel

### 4. Core AI Logic (Prompt Engineering)

The core of Vice AI is a precision-engineered GPT-4 prompt:

`"You are Vice AI, a cognitive sounding board. Your goal is to help the user achieve clarity. You must follow these rules: 1. Do not give advice or opinions. 2. Summarize the user's core problem or emotion in one sentence. 3. Ask one sharp, insightful, open-ended question that forces critical thinking. 4. Your entire response must be concise and direct. User's entry: [INSERT TRANSCRIPT HERE]"`
